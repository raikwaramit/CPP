# OOP : Object oriented programming.

- Object oriented programming basically creating a design of the data and its related properties / function. And creating object (Basically instances) which have its own data and properties.

## Class/object

A class is basically a user defined data type which contains its own datatype, properties and uses constructor mechanism to create object or act as object constructor.
The number of object can be any number of instance.

Access specifier is very important while defining the attributes and functions.

## Class methods

Methods or functions defined inside the class.

## Constructor

This is special function which is invoked at the time of creating object or constructing objects using class.  
Name of the constructor function is always same as the class name.

## Access specifier

As the name suggests, there are some keywords which are responsible for specifying the access of the attributes and function outside of the class. Types: private | public | protected.

## Encapsulation.

Basically this means not exposing the sensitive data outside and make sure its hidden from users.
Sensitive data should alway be kept private.

## Inheritence

Basically, it means using the same class as base class its attributes and functions to create another derived class.

- We can access protected properties.
- We can override function implementation.
- We can add extra properties and function.

### Multilevel inheritence

- Inhereting a base class to multilevel child.

### Multiple inheritence

- Using one base class and creating multiple child / derived classes.

## Polymorphism

Overriding a parent class functions and overriding implementation in each derived class, so this allow use to call the corresponding function implementation based on the object instance class.
