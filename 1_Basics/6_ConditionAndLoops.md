# Conditions and loops

## if else

if(condition) {} else {}

## if else if

if (condition) {} else if (condition) {} else {}

## Nested if else

if (condition) {} else { if (condition) {} else {} }

## Ternary operator

condition ? {true code block}: {false code block}.

## Switch statement

switch (condition)
{
case match: {
codeblock;
break
}
default: {
code block
}
}
-> water fall mechanism

## White and do while.

- while(condition is true){
  keep running this block of code.
  }

- dowhile{
  runthis code
  } while(then check the condition whether its true or not);

## For loop

for ( initialisation; condition; update expression)
{
codeblock to be executed repeatedly.
}

**Please note**

- Initialisation and update expression can be outside and inside respectively.
- We can add multiple update and initialisation in the for loop itself.

## Nested loop

Loop inside a loop.

## For-each

In the very first update of the CPP+11 for-each support was added, since people dont use it much they are unaware of this.

for(int number : number []){

}

## Breake and continue

### Break

- It is used to jump out of the loop or switch statement.

### Continue

- It is used to skip the code block and move to the next iteration
