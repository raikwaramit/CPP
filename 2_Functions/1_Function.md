# Function

Return type of a function can be any datatype or structure.
Note: If we dont want to return anything from a function we just add void type in the return type of the function.

# Function parameter

## Parameter v/s arguments

While declaring a function the information to be passed in the parenthesis are called parameters.
When these parameter are passed while passing

## Default parameter value

Function with a default parameter is called optional parameter.

`void myFunction(string country = "Norway") `

## Muliple arguments

`void myFunction(string fname, int age) {`

## return values

Using the return keyword with the value.

## Pass by reference

use of `&` as this is required to pass the reference.

# Function overloading

A function having the same name but the count of the parameter/argument

# Scope:

## Local scope

It is useful for the local variables defined inside a {} is called as local scope. The variables and function defined inside that scope are not accessible outside of the program.

## Global scope

The variable and functions that are defined outside of the {} scope are accessible from anywhere from the program file.

## Recursion

Calling the same function inside the implementation of the function. Important point is it should be called carefully as it can be infinite call loop. It should have a terminating condition.
